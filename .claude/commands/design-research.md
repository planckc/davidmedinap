description: Research design references using Exa and Firecrawl MCPs
---

Research design inspiration for the portfolio:

1. Ask user what type of design they want to research (e.g., "modern portfolio", "AI blog design", "interactive hero sections")

2. Use Exa MCP to search for high-quality design references:
   - Search query: user's design type
   - Filter for modern, professional sites
   - Return 5-6 top results

3. For each result, use Firecrawl MCP to:
   - Scrape the page
   - Analyze design elements (colors, typography, layout)
   - Extract key patterns

4. Present findings to user:
   - Option A: [Site name] - [Key features]
   - Option B: [Site name] - [Key features]
   - Option C: [Site name] - [Key features]

5. Ask which design direction they prefer

6. Optional: Document findings in `docs/design/references/`

Note: Uses Exa and Firecrawl MCPs configured in .claude/mcp.json
